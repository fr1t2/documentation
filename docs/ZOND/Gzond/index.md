Go-zond (aka Gzond) is an Zond client built in [Go](https://go.dev). It is one of the original and most popular Zond clients.
These documentation pages are intended to help users download, install and use Gzond.

## Where to go from here \{#where-to-go}

First, make sure you have sufficient [hardware](/docs/getting-started/hardware-requirements), then [download](/downloads) and [install](/docs/getting-started/installing-gzond) Gzond. Make sure you are familiar with the [security considerations](/docs/fundamentals/security) and have your firewall set up.

If you are just starting out with Gzond, head to the [Getting started](/docs/getting-started/) page. That page guides new users through some basic functions of Gzond such as creating and securing accounts and making a transaction.

Then, it is recommended to read the material in the [Fundamentals](/docs/fundamentals) section - these pages will help build a foundational understanding of how Gzond works from a user perspective and under the hood.

More advanced topics are also available - explore them using the sidebar!

## Developers and contributors \{#developers-and-contributors}

If you want to help develop Gzond or build decentralized apps on top of it, head to our [Developer](/docs/developers) documentation.

## More resources \{#more-resources}

We have a library of videos and articles on our [Resources](/docs/resources) page and answers to common questions on the [FAQs](/docs/faq) page.
