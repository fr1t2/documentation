:::note

Gzond no longer publishes builds for mobile.

:::
 
 
In the past, Gzond was released for Android and IoS to support embedding clients into mobile applications. However, the move to proof-of-stake based consensus introduced the need for a consensus client to be run alongside Gzond in order to track the head of the blockchain, breaking the ability for Gzond light clients to run on a mobile device and handle API requests from mobile apps.

Supporting mobile app development is [no longer part of Gzond's remit](https://github.com/zond/go-zond/pull/26599) but it remains possible for other teams to devise ways to build on Zond in a mobile environment.
