:::note
Puppeth was [removed from Gzond](https://github.com/zond/go-zond/pull/26581) in January 2023.
:::

Puppeth was a tool for quickly spinning up and managing private development networks. The user was guided through the process by a command line wizard instead of having to configure the network manually. However, this tool has been discontinued and removed from the Gzond repository.

Instructions for setting up a private network using Ethash or Clique are available on our [private networks page](/docs/fundamentals/private-network).
