[Web3Signer](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3signer) is an open-source remote signing service developed by Consensys. Qrysm users can use this tool as an alternative to storing keys locally. Web3Signer uses REST APIs to sign transactions and messages.

Web3Signer follows the [Remote Signing API](https://github.com/ethereum/remote-signing-api) specification.

Qrysm supports the use of Web3Signer the following flags:

`--validators-external-signer-url` : base URL for the Web3Signer.

example:
```
--validators-external-signer-url=http://localhost:9000
```

the flag is also aliased to `--remote-signer-url`

example:
```
--remote-signer-url=http://localhost:9000
```

It is recommended to use `https` for the Web3Signer url. Qrysm currently supports one to one on Web3Signer and does not support multiple key management systems with the same validator client. Qrysm does not support partial local and partial remote key management. Web3signer does not support authentication between the validator client and the signer.


- `--validators-external-signer-public-keys`: Comma separated list of public validator keys in hex format or an external url endpoint for the validator to retrieve public keys in JSON format.

HEX example: 
```
--validators-external-signer-public-keys=0xa99a...e44c,0xb89b...4a0b
```

URL example:
```
--validators-external-signer-public-keys=https://web3signer.com/api/v1/eth2/publicKeys
```

The flag is also aliased to `--remote-signer-keys`

example:
```
--remote-signer-keys=0xa99a...e44c,0xb89b...4a0b
```

URLs will only pull once and does not poll. Additional keys can be added or removed via the Remote Keymanager API.

:::tip Running Qrysm with Web3Signer does not need Qrysm Wallet Creation
Most Qrysm keymanager types require a corresponding Qrysm wallet for storing keys, the web3signer type doesn't use any locally stored Qrysm wallet.
The `--wallet-dir` flag will still be needed if using the Remote Keymanager API for `auth-token` purposes.
:::

## Remote Keymanager API 

[Keymanager APIs](https://github.com/ethereum/keymanager-APIs) is a recommended set of REST APIs that validator clients have agreed upon for managing keys.

The Remote Keymanager APIs allows Qrysm users to list, update, and delete the public keys set on the validator for Web3Signer.

To use the Remote keymanager API, one would need to run the validator with the `--web` and `--validators-external-signer-url` flags with `--validators-external-signer-public-keys` being optional. 
if `--validators-external-signer-public-keys` is not defined the validator client would simply run in a loop waiting for keys to be set. 

example:
```
validator --web --validators-external-signer-url=http://localhost:9000
```

The `--web` flag will enable validator client APIs as well as the web ui ( not supported for web3signer ). A JWT token ( found on the second line of the auth-token file) will be generated in the qrysm default wallet directory otherwise defined by `--wallet-dir` flag. the token will also be printed in the console:
```
[2022-04-15 14:07:39]  INFO rpc: http://127.0.0.1:7500/initialize?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.ck3J6tcvHcI74IiFjyJqcBH-MmNAq-fMr0ncyZkGvFM
```
The token needs to be copied and set in the header of the API request:
```
Authorization: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.e30.ck3J6tcvHcI74IiFjyJqcBH-MmNAq-fMr0ncyZkGvFM`
```

:::warning Qrysm Web Interface not supported for Web3Signer
Qrysm Web Interface can only support local keys and will not support the Web3Signer keys.[eth2-keymanager-frontend](https://github.com/joaquim-verges/eth2-keymanager-frontend) is a front-end alternative to the Qrysm UI for the Keymanager APIs.
:::

:::warning Only supports Web3Signer currently
The remote keymanager API only currently supports Web3Signer types, please use the regular keymanager API for locally stored keys.
:::

:::tip Beacon Chain needs to be synced for use
Both Keymanager APIs are only supported when the beacon chain syncs.

## Public Key Persistence

The public keys set on the validator for a remote signer are `NOT` persisted by `DEFAULT`. 
This means that if the validator client restarts, only the public keys set via flag options will be used on the validator and keys set via the Remote Keymanager API will be lost.

Keys can be persisted by setting the `--validators-external-signer-key-file` set to a file path.

example:
```
--validators-external-signer-key-file=/path/to/keyfile.txt
```
the flag is also aliased to `--remote-signer-keys-file`

example:
```
--remote-signer-keys-file=/path/to/keyfile.txt
```
Keys updated via the Remote Keymanager API will be persisted to the file as a hex string, one key per line.

If the file is removed or the file is empty, the validator will revert to the public keys set via the `--validators-external-signer-public-keys` flag.

On restart, the validator will read the file and set the public keys from the file.
