:::danger Alpha testing
This functionality is in its early stage alpha testing and may not be fully functional at this time. 
:::

This section provides instructions on how to run the `client-stats` CLI utility to collect metrics from your Qrysm validator or beacon node processes and push them to the [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in)  stats service.

## Why is this a separate process?

In order to ensure that running `client-stats` is an intentional action on the part of the user, we have chosen to break it out into a separate executable that needs to be run on its own. It can be run on the same host as the validator client and/or beacon node, or on a separate host with access to the remote host ip and port.

:::danger Do not run a second validator
You need to run the `client-stats` executable, **not** another instance of `validator`. You could get yourself slashed if running a second instance of `validator`.
:::

## API URL
The [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) `client-stats` collection endpoint is authenticated via an api key embedded in the server UEL path. A unique identifier for the machine name can also be added to the path. When you configure your account with [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in) they will give you the api key, simply replace `{apikey}` in the example commands below. If you do not wish to use the machine name feature, that part of the path can simply be excluded. For example, to specify a machine name:

    https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

Or without the machine name:

    https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}

## Running client-stats

To collect metrics from your validator node, assuming that your validator is running on localhost:

    client-stats --validator-metrics-url=http://localhost:8081/metrics --clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

To collect metrics from your beacon node, also assuming that the beacon node is running on localhost:

    client-stats --beacon-node-metrics-url=http://localhost:8080/metrics --clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

To collect metrics from both, also assuming that the validator and beacon node are running on localhost:

    client-stats --validator-metrics-url=http://localhost:8081/metrics --beacon-node-metrics-url=http://localhost:8080/metrics --clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

To run client-stats from `qrysm.sh` or `qrysm.bat`, while adjusting the parameters to `client-stats` as per the above:

    qrysm.sh client-stats --validator-metrics-url=http://localhost:8081/metrics --beacon-node-metrics-url=http://localhost:8080/metrics --clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

or

    qrysm.bat client-stats --validator-metrics-url=http://localhost:8081/metrics --beacon-node-metrics-url=http://localhost:8080/metrics --clientstats-api-url=https://beaconcha.in/api/v1/stats/{apikey}/{machineName}

If you see an error message that `PROCESS can be beacon-chain, validator, or slasher.`, you need to manually update the `qrysm.sh` or `qrysm.bat` file to
its latest version, see [download instructions](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/install/install-with-script).

# What metrics does client-stats collect?

To get a detailed picture of exactly what `client-stats` collects, try running the commands without a `--clientstats-api-url` argument. In this `debug` mode, `client-stats` will print the JSON messages to stdout, so you can look at exactly what data would be sent to the remote server.
