**Slashing** is a mechanism designed to encourage good behavior on the Zond network and discourage attacks and bad behavior. Where a validator is found to have broken the rules it will be slashed and removed from the network. In addition to being removed from the network, the entire validator stake may be removed. 

Being slashed is the result of a validator undertaking one of three “bad” actions: 

1. As a proposer, sign two different beacon blocks for the same slot.
2. As an attester, sign an attestation that surrounds another (surround vote).
3. As an attester, sign two different attestations having the same target.

**Slashing is a permanent action.** 

## Slashing protection

Basic slashing protection is enabled by default using a database that keeps track of objects your validator has previously signed, ensuring the validator does not sign the same message again, causing a violation and getting slashed.
