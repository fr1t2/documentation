A mnemonic phrase is a list of words that cryptographically represent the seed when compared to a given word list and passed through an algorithm. 

The QRL uses [this wordlist](https://github.com/theQRL/qrllib/blob/4c63c7e4976ba111e5e405de466f824d8ef1deb8/src/rust_wrapper/qrl/wordlist.rs#L4) to generate mnemonic phrase that represents a QRL addresses secret keys.

Depending on where these words are in the list assigns a unique number to each word. When passed through an [algorithm](https://github.com/theQRL/wallet.js/blob/bcf1587bea0455554e669c775c38faeca6faa1e3/src/utils/mnemonic.js#L2) they produce the same SEED used to generate a XMSS tree. 

The Mnemonic is a user friendly way to represent the hexseed and is less error prone than a hexseed when a user is presented with backing up and storing key information.
